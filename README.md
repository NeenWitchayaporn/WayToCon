# WayToCon
WayToCon is a web application about concert ticket booking. My responsibility in this project is to be the full-stack developer for the "product" part of the staff role. For example, create a new product, show a list of products, etc. In addition, I created a database for use in the project.

**This is my first time creating a web application. By devoting time to learning how to code and working diligently until success within a period of 2 weeks. This project demonstrates my commitment to learning and the practical application of coding skills. Throughout the development process, I faced challenges and learned valuable lessons that contributed to my growth as a developer.
