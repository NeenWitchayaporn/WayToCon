# WayToCon
WayToCon is a web application about concert ticket booking. My responsibility in this project is to be the full-stack developer for the "product" part of the staff role. For example, create a new product, show a list of products, etc. In addition, I created a database for use in the project.

**This is the first project I undertook, dedicating time to studying how to write code and diligently working on it until completion. Within a span of 2 weeks, I successfully developed a usable web application. The project showcases my commitment to learning and practical application of coding skills. Throughout the development process, I encountered challenges and learned valuable lessons that contributed to my growth as a developer.
